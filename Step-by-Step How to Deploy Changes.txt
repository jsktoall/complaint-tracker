Step-by-Step: How to Deploy Changes to Render
🛠️ Step 1: Make and Save Your Code Changes
Make sure all changes (HTML, Python, settings, etc.) are saved in your project folder.

💾 Step 2: Stage and Commit the Changes
Open Command Prompt in your project directory (where manage.py is located):

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Your message describing the change"
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Fixed duplicate complaint display issue"
🚀 Step 3: Push the Changes to GitHub
bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
This uploads your code to GitHub, which is connected to Render.

⚙️ Step 4: Trigger Deployment on Render
If Render is set to auto-deploy from GitHub (which it usually is):

It will automatically detect the new changes and start building.

You can visit https://dashboard.render.com → click on your web service → and watch the deployment logs.

If you don’t see the build start automatically, click the "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit" button.

🔄 Step 5: Wait for Deployment to Finish
You’ll see a green “Live” label once it’s deployed successfully. Takes ~1–3 minutes usually.

📱 Step 6: Open Your Website URL
Open the URL Render gave you (like https://your-app-name.onrender.com) on any browser or mobile device and test the changes.
